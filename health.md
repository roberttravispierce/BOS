## Eating

### 1. Eat healthy, unprocessed foods
I limit carbs, sugars and processed foods as much as possible. I’ve learned to not stress over food, but recognize that eating well is vital to being healthy, fit and capable.

### 2. Eat your water—drink your food
I try to  chew each bite of food 40+ times—liquefying it.
This improves digestion and slows down my eating to allow the satiation mechanisms to kick in (15-20mins?). I drink water slowly; which adds my saliva.

### 3. Eat between 10am and 6pm
I find I function better if I intermittent fast from early evening until mid-morning. This is flexible, depending on how hungry I feel—but it's a good guideline.

### 4. Drink only water
I drink filtered water almost exclusively. I try not to drink calories.

I occasionally drink yerba mate, herb tea, or even coffee, throughout the day.
