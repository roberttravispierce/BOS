## Eating

### 1. Eat mostly raw, whole, live foods

### 2. Eat your water—drink your food
I chew each bite of food 40+ times—liquefying it.
This improves digestion and slows down my eating to allow the satiation mechanisms to kick in (15-20mins?). I drink water slowly; which adds my saliva.

### 3. Eat between 10am and 6pm
I find I function better if I intermittent fast from early evening until mid-morning. This is flexible, depending on how hungry I feel—but it's a good guideline.

### 4. Drink only water
I drink filtered water almost exclusively. I try not to drink calories.

I occasionally drink herb tea, or even coffee, throughout the day. Since COVID-19, I've started drinking a glass of water with [Emergen-C®](https://www.emergenc.com/) in the morning for an extra immunity/C boost.
