## Eating

### 1. Eat only live, whole foods

### 2. Eat your water—drink your food
I chew each bite of food 40+ times—liquefying it.
This improves digestion and slows down my eating to allow the satiation mechanisms to kick in (15-20mins?). I drink water slowly; which adds my saliva.

### 3. Eat slowly and deliberately

### 4. Don’t drink calories
I just drink water.

I do drink a glass of [Emergen-C®](https://www.emergenc.com/) in the morning, along with herb teas and even coffee occasionally.
